Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Intro

A few days ago The Washington Post called Threads as “Meta’s new Twitter clone”. Well, it is hard to deny that Threads is, indeed, too much like Twitter. Correction: old Twitter, the one that was loved by users before Elon Musk took over and brought the changes. But what is the difference between Twitter and Threads from a product perspective? Twitter is a full-blown product whereas Threads is MVP: minimum viable product.

While Twitter totally fits the CRUD rules (create, read, update, delete) from the operational language concept, in Threads you can’t even delete your own account unless you deactivate your Instagram account. Is it a tricky way of keeping people inside the app, or it’s just a consequence of being an MVP — the time will tell.

Twitter itself was introduced in 2006 and it was released as proof of MVP conception. However, over time and with the development of the product, Twitter has significantly expanded its functionality, adding new features such as images, videos, polls, the “retweet” function, and others. The product has become more complex and diverse, which goes beyond a simple MVP.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.

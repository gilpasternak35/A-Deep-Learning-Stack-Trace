Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite


A few days ago The Washington Post called Threads as “Meta’s new Twitter clone”. Well, it is hard to deny that Threads is, indeed, too much like Twitter. Correction: old Twitter, the one that was loved by users before Elon Musk took over and brought the changes. But what is the difference between Twitter and Threads from a product perspective? Twitter is a full-blown product whereas Threads is MVP: minimum viable product.

While Twitter totally fits the CRUD rules (create, read, update, delete) from the operational language concept, in Threads you can’t even delete your own account unless you deactivate your Instagram account. Is it a tricky way of keeping people inside the app, or it’s just a consequence of being an MVP — the time will tell.

Twitter itself was introduced in 2006 and it was released as proof of MVP conception. However, over time and with the development of the product, Twitter has significantly expanded its functionality, adding new features such as images, videos, polls, the “retweet” function, and others. The product has become more complex and diverse, which goes beyond a simple MVP.

We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be
I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center
How nice -- to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.

I am an arms dealer
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in
… This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
… I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh so intricate yeah
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh so intricate yeah
… I wrote the gospel on giving up (you look pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk (prima donnas of the gutter)
At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars
No, more like p-p-parties
… This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another
In machine learning, feature learning or representation learning[2] is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

The Overlook Hotel claimed the most beautfiul physical setting of any resort in the world; but Jack Torrance, the new winter caretaker, with his wife, Wendy and their five-year-old son Danny, saw much more than its splendor.

Jack saw the Overlook as an opportunity, a desperate way back from failure and despair; Wendy saw this lonely sanctuary as a frail chance to preserve their family; and Danny?....Danny, who was blessed or cursed with a shining, precognitive gift, saw visions hideously beyond the comprehension of a small boy. He sensed the evil coiled within the Overlook's one hundred and ten empty rooms; an evil that was waiting just for them.

The Shining, by Stephen King, the undisputed master of the modern horror story.

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know fo sho (uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now (uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how (c'mon)

I think I'm drowning, asphyxiated
I wanna break this spell that you've created
Your something beautiful, a contradiction
I wanna play the game, I want the friction
You will be the death of me
Yeah, you will be the death of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
And our time is running out
And our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
I wanted freedom, bound and restricted
I tried to give you up, but I'm addicted
Now that you know I'm trapped, sense of elation
You'd never dream of breaking this fixation

Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I'm an animal, something like a cannibal
I'm very flammable and partially programmable
Centuries of overuse, now I wear it nice and loose
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, it's ubiquitous, tell me, can you stick to this?
I'm on the brink of this and tell me what you think of this
I'm in the Beauregard, slow me down if I get hard
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Gonna get you now
Her perfume smells like gasoline
My girlfriend's trash is nice and clean
Acid landing on my tongue
I think you know we've just begun
She don't want the ladies room
Transatlantic super groom
Your hairplane is a monument
The sexy art of condiments
And now I know you by your scent
Let it bleed we both get bent
Need a minute to prepare
Sonny's side was always Cher
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I believe in love, perfectly receiving love
It's vociferous and come and get a whiff of this
I'm at the pyramids, never had a fear of kids
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
I'm on the precipice, I come and make a mess of this
It's the apocalypse, I try to get a sock of this
I'm at the county fair
Haystack ride, I'll pull your hair
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Gonna get you now

It's cruel you know
The way they've been treating you lately
Get you real messed up on the daily
They tell you things you want
To hear they say, well
Honey, lover, what would I do without you?
But at the end of the day it's a game
So many mouths and they're
Moving the same way
But you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast
I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
It's what you give that's got
Me locked up feeling hazy
I cut all the lines but it's crazy
So I say what I, what I always say like
Is it what you want? Is it what you need?
Is there something else you needed from me?
Try to take a collar to a dog with no owner
Tell him sit, lay down
Roll over it's strange
I'm caught up, I'm lost in the game
I move while they beg me to stay
And I've been feeling broke up since I
Woke up but it's a new day
When I say what I needed, needed to say
And you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
Tides turn as bridges burn
There's a road being cut through the thick
You hate me, you love me
Your friends want to cut me
But it's all the same, ain't it?
It's the same way and you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
It's the same way but you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
No, no i'm not at the end of it
No, no i'm not at the end of it

There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
There's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
